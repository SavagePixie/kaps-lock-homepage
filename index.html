                Hello! My name's Kristina, I live in Stockholm, but I come from Perm, Russia. <br/> 
                Before I decided to change my career and pursue my dream of becoming a developer, I used to work as an English teacher for 11 years. <br/>
                I've done an intensive Java course before I started &lsaquo;/Salt&rsaquo; and now I'm happy to be discoving JavaScript! <br/>
                I like travelling, doing sports and watching series in my free time.

            <p>I used to work in catering and facilities management before &lsaquo;/salt&rsaquo;. I value maintanable and readable code and I'm a big fan of functional programming. I like looking out the window on rainy days wrapped under a blanket with a good book in my hands.</p>

                <p>Hello, My name is Pontus, I'm 23 years old and I live in Stockholm.</p><p>I've been into web development for about 2 years. I got into coding because I found a crash course in Java a couple of years ago, I dove into the video tutorial and I began learning. Ever since i've been trying to become better at programming every day. As I began writing JavaScript I became more and more interested in web development and about a year ago I knew that wanted to make a living out of it.</p> In my spare time, when I'm not in front of my computer screen, I love to ski. For obvious reasons I can only do this a couple of months each year so other than that I like to spend time with my family and friends.
